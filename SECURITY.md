# Kafe Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We take the security of our systems seriously, and we value the security community. The disclosure of security
vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of our users.

### Guidelines

We require that all researchers:

* Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and
  destruction of data during security testing;
* Perform research only within the scope set out below;
* Use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability information to us; and
* Keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered confidential between yourself and Kafe developers until
  we’ve had 60 days to resolve the issue.

If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we commit to:

* Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research;
* Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly (including an initial confirmation of your report within 72
  hours of submission);
* Recognize your contribution on our source repository, if you are the first to report the issue and we make a code or
  configuration change based on the issue.

### Scope

* Source code made available at https://github.com/libkafe/kafe
* Binary builds made available at https://github.com/libkafe/kafe

### Out of scope

Any services hosted by 3rd party providers and services are excluded from scope. These services include:

* GitHub
* Managed Kafe services or 3rd party software embedding kafe or libkafe

### How to report a security vulnerability?

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in one of our products or platforms please send it to us by
