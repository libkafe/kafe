# Kafe Vulnerability Disclosure Policy 

We take the security of our systems seriously, and we value the security community. The disclosure of security
vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of our users.

### Guidelines  
We require that all researchers:
* Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, 
    and destruction of data during security testing;
* Perform research only within the scope set out below; 
* Use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability information to us; and
* Keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered confidential between yourself and Kafe developers 
    until we’ve had 60 days to resolve the issue.

If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we commit to:
* Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research;
* Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly (including an initial confirmation of your report within
    72 hours of submission); 
* Recognize your contribution on our source repository, if you are the first to report the issue and we make a code or 
    configuration change based on the issue.

### Scope  
* Source code made available at https://github.com/libkafe/kafe
* Binary builds made available at https://github.com/libkafe/kafe

### Out of scope  
Any services hosted by 3rd party providers and services are excluded from scope. These services include:

* GitHub
* Managed Kafe services or 3rd party software embedding kafe or libkafe

### How to report a security vulnerability?  
If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in one of our products or platforms please send it to us by emailing 
mrtreinis@gmail.com. Please include the following details with your report:

* Description of the location and potential impact of the vulnerability;
* A detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability (POC scripts, etc.); and
